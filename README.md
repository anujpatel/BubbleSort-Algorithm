BubbleSort-Algorithm
====================

Bubble Sort algorithm Implementation using Java

In Bubble Sort, smaller elements bubbles to top of list in ascending sorting hence it's called Bubble Sort.

How it works :

    1. In Bubble Sort, You take first element and second element initially and compare both elements.
    2. If second element is smaller than first element then you swipe places. how? using temp :)
    3. You keep doing same meaning stepping through array and comparing element with pair of adjacent elements until no         swapping required and you have sorted array
